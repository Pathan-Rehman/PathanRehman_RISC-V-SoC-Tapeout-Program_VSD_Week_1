# Week 1 Overview - VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program

Welcome to the summary of Week 1 labs! This week focused on foundational concepts and practical exercises in Verilog RTL design and synthesis. Below are the key topics and tasks completed each day:

## Day-wise Lab Summary

- **Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis**
  - Explored the basics of Verilog RTL design
  - Performed synthesis to generate gate-level representations

- **Day 2: Timing Libraries, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis, and Efficient Flop Coding Styles**
  - Worked with timing libraries for synthesis optimization
  - Compared hierarchical and flat synthesis methodologies
  - Practiced efficient flop coding for reliable designs

- **Day 3: Combinational and Sequential Optimizations**
  - Implemented various combinational optimizations
  - Enhanced sequential logic for performance and area

- **Day 4: GLS, Blocking vs Non-Blocking Assignments and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch**
  - Ran Gate Level Simulations (GLS)
  - Investigated blocking vs non-blocking assignment behaviors
  - Learned to identify and resolve synthesis-simulation mismatches

- **Day 5: Optimization in Synthesis**
  - Applied advanced synthesis optimizations
  - Analyzed synthesis reports for further improvements
